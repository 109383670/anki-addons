"""
A list of audiodownloaders.

They are intendet for use with the Anki2 audiodownload add-on, but can
possibly be used alone. For each downloader in the list, setting its
language variable and then calling download_files(text, base, ruby)
downloads audio files to temp files and fills its downloads_list with
the file names.

As this is intendet as part of a PyQt programme, this module requires
PyQt4, too.
