Anki2 add-on to download pronunciations.

This add-on downloads pronunciations from a number of sites
Japanese-pod: This looks for a field called reading(*) and tries to
              get a pronunciation from the languagepod website. As the
              name suggests, these are only Japanese words. The
              pronunciations that are there are rather high-quality,
              though.

Google TTS: Get pronunciations from the Google Text-To-Speech
            service. These are robot voices, so be a bit suspicous
            about them. Can speak whole sentences.
Merriam-Webster: American English. Just single words.
BeoLingus: Planned. May download English, German and Spanish words.

There are three ways to download: Current card, current note and
manual.
 * The current card download looks at audio field in what is
   currently shown and tries to download only for those. This should
   limit the information leaked before you answer a card.
 * Current note tries to fill all audio fields of the current
   note. This may reveal, that information that you tried to remember,
   potentially ahead of time.
 * Manual works like current note, but shows a list of candidate
   strings that can be modified before the requests are sent.
