Edit audio files with
[mhWaveEdit](https://gna.org/projects/mhwaveedit/).

There are two ways to start the editor:

* During reviews, trigger the `Edit/Media/Edit audio` menu item to
start the editor with the audio files of the current card. Then edit
them there and save. Replay in Anki to hear the effect.
* In the card editor, click in a field with audio, that is with
  `[sonud:NN]`, and click the “W” button at the top.

<blockquote class="nb">
You have to install the audio editor by yourself. It is a Linux
program, on most distributions you should be able to install it
via the package manager.
