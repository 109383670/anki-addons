status: Anki 2.1 α keeps crashing
---
While i generally welcome the coming Anki version that uses Python 3 and Qt 5, these add-ons aren’t yet ready for it.

The thing is that the Anki α version is terribly unstable on my
Linux machine, crashing usually seconds after i start it. Like
 this there is no way i can carefully test Python 3 versions of
 these add-ons. I suspect the PyQt version rather than Anki specifically, but that doesn’t change the fact that i can’t run the Anki α.

There *is* a branch, [`develop-anki21`](https://github.com/ospalh/anki-addons/tree/develop-anki21), where i have started the Python 2 → Python 3 conversion anyway. The other add-ons <em>may</em> work, but, as i couldn’t test it, i have no idea.</p>
