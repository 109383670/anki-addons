While i generally welcome the coming Anki version that uses Python 3 and Qt 5, the standard versions have not been ported.

There *is* a branch, [`develop-anki21`](https://github.com/ospalh/anki-addons/tree/develop-anki21) with Python 2 → Python 3 ports, mostly done by [Marcio Mazza](https://github.com/marciomazza). The [download audio]({{ site.github.url }}/Download_audio.html) reportedly works. Some standard work was done for the othe add-ons as well, and you may try them out, they may – or may not – work.

I personally could not test these ports. On one of
my machines the Anki α version is terribly unstable, crashing usually
seconds after i start it. I suspect the PyQt version rather than Anki
specifically, but that doesn’t change the fact that i can’t run the
Anki α on that machine. Another one unhelpfully informs me that
“Your Qt version is known to be broken.”
