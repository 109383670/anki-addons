"""
Add-on for Anki 2 to trigger the display of my mouse-hover hints.

I do my hints not with the {{hint:NN}} method but with a method similarly to
the one i wrote about at
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/ankisrs-users/ORpr0lsl9AE

But sometimes a want to trigger that without the mouse, so, pressing
'i' changes the class of the hints so they become visible.
