When adding new material, it is easiest to use the standard models this
add-on brings along.

Follow these steps:

### First use of the standard model

* Click the <q>Add</q> item in the tool bar or press the <q>a</q> key to open
  the add card window.
* Click on the button at the top left, next to the word <q>Type</q>. It
  shows the currently selected model, maybe <q>Basic</q> or <q>Cloze</q>.
* In the <q>Choose Note Type</q> window click the <q>Manage</q> button at the
  bottom.
* In the <q>Note Types</q> window, click <q>Add</q>, top right.
* In the <q>Add Note Type</q> window, select the <q>Add: Standard with
  audio fields</q> line or, when you are learning Japanese and have the
  [Japanese support](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3918629684)
  add-on installed, <q>Add: Japanese with audio fields</q> line and
  click <Q>OK</Q>
* Either keep the name or change it in the next dialog and click <Q>OK</Q>.
* Close the <q>Note Types</q> dialog.
* Bring the <q>Choose Note Type</q> window to the front
* It should now contain a line with <q>Standard with audio fields</q> or
  the name you choose three steps back
* Select that line and click <q>Choose</q>
* Complain at the
  [Anki issue tracker](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/ankidesktop)
  that this process is too complicated, if you think so.
* After clicking <q>Choose</q> two steps back, you can enter new words in
  the <q>Add</q> window. The megaphone button should now work and bring up the
  <q>Download audio</q> dialog.

### Cards

These two models create three cards per note, recognition (foreign →
native), recall (native → foreign), and audio, (spoken word → foreign
and native). See the Anki manual on
[cards and templates](http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#cards-and-templates)
for ways to change this.

### Adding notes later

When you click <q>Add</q> after the model has been added once, this model
may be selected when the add note window appears. If not, it can be
chosen from the list that appears when you click on the current note type.

### Changing note types

Instead of changing an existing model by adding an
[audio field](Add_audio_field.html) and that field
[to the cards](Add_audio_to_card.html) – the method that is
still preferred for more complex models – existing basic notes can
also be changed to the newly created audio models:

* Sync. First with all other clients (other computers, mobile devices,
  AnkiWeb), then the local computer.
* Open the card browser
* On the left, click the model where you want to use audio
* In the card list, select all cards (Ctrl+A), or just those cards you
  want to use audio for
* Trigger the browsers menu item <q>Edit/Change Note Type ...</q>
* For <q>New note type:</q> select the <q>… with audio</q> type.
* Check that no information will be lost. When you see that something
  will be changed to <q>Nothing</q>, you may be better off with modifying
  the existing *model*, rather than changing *notes* from one model to another.
* Click OK
* You will get a warning that you will have to do a full sync. Choose
  <q>upload</q> when doing the next sync.
