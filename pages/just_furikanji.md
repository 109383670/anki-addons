Render kanji *above* the kana. Useful for listening comprehension.

Use `{{furikanji:Field name}}` in the template.

While this add-on works, it has been superseded by
[Furikanji](Furikanji.html).

In the past *this* add-on was called Furikanji and what is now
Furikanji was called Furigana mod. (As neither had been uploaded to
Ankiweb, i hope the confusion is not too great (if it exists at all).
