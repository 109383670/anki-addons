The idea was to quickly replay everything using vlc.

Unfortunately it turned out that the i have a bunch of half-broken
not-quite-ogg files lying around that most programs can play, but vlc
can't. So i just gave up on this. Sorry.

Use [Quick replay](Quick replay.html) instead. Maybe it will find the
on board mplayer one day.
