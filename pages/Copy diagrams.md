This is a chimera of parts of my
[Kanji stroke color](Kanji%20stroke%20color.html) and Cayennens’
original
[Kanji Colorizer](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1964372878). The
name is misleading, it does not copy anything, but fills the
collection with embed tags for my version of the SVGs of the colored
stroke order diagrams.

The SVGs themselves are not copied. The paths in the collection are
also wrong. I used it once to make my Kanji deck useable with an
unpatched AnkiDroid and am done with this now. It will stay in this
pretty much useles state.
