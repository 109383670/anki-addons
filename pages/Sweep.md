Edit audio files with
[sweep](http://www.metadecks.org/software/sweep/).

Trigger the `Edit/Media/Edit audio` menu item to start sweep with the
audio files of the current card. Then edit them there and save. Replay
in Anki to hear the effect.

The audio editor itself isnâ€™t all that
stable. Complain to the authors of that piece of software when you
encounter problems with it, not to me. When you can get hold of them.
