Replace the top menu bar with the “Decks Study Add Browse” text
buttons and the two rather drab sync and statistics buttons with a
colorful icon toolbar like the one in Anki 1.

The edit button and the more button in the bottom bar are also
replaced by an icon tool bar.

This also adds a few more menu items and adds icons to the menus (not on Macs).
The tool bars can be shown and hidden via the "View" menu, the “Decks
Study Add Browse” functions can also be reached through the "Go" menu.



## Variants

Appart from the standard version, there is a netbook version on the
AnkiWeb download page, that places the two icon bars to the left and
right, to preserve vertical screen space. On github, there is also a branch
named `ospalh-special` with a slightly different icon selection more
to the personal taste of the author.

changes to the icons shown.

## Replacing icons

The icons used are stored in the folder
`Anki/addons/color-icons`. They can be simply replaced by icons more to the
personal taste of the user.

## What *is* the capital of Niue?
