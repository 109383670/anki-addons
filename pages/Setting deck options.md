Setting the language in the deck options isn't too hard, but a
step-by-step guide may be useful.




## Deck options

To permanently set the language change it in the new “Language code”
field in the deck options.

In the deck selector, click on the gear button to the right of the
deck name, then select “”options“”. In the dialog that opens, click on the
“”general“” tab. Enter the code for your language in the “Language
code” text field.

This setting is done by options group. Each deck has an options group,
but these goups can be shared between decks. See the
[Anki manual](http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#deckoptions) for
more details.

Through the options group mechanism, different decks can use different
download languages.
