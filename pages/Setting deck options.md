During start-up, only one language code is set for all decks.

To change this language later, or to use more than one foreign
language, the language code can be changed in the deck options.

## Deck options

Each deck has an options group,
but these groups can be shared between decks. See the
[Anki manual](http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#deckoptions) for
more details.

This will open the <q>Options for NN</q> dialog. There, click on the
<q>General</q> tab. On that sheet, change the language code in new input
field.


## Adding deck options

When learning different languages, arrange the notes in different
decks and add an option groups for each deck:

As above, click on the gear and select <q>Options</q>. In the
<q>Options for NN</q> dialog, near the top, beside the option group
name list, there is another gear button. Click on that and select
<q>Add</q>. Enter a new name. Putting the language name into the
options name helps keeping them apart. Then, go to the <q>General</q>
tab and set the language code again.
