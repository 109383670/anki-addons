This is a quick hack to play mp3 files with a dedicated mp3 player,
rather than with mplayer. This intentionally bypasses the mplayer play
queue. The advantage is that replaying the media starts immediately,
even before the first playing is finished.

The disadvantage is that
when a card contains several audio files, they are played
simultaneously, which is usually not what we want.
The [Quick replay](Quick%20replay.html) add-on should fix
this problem.
