abstract: Add note id to cards. Like this, cards are automatically unique.
first_image: furikanji.png
first_alt: The first field of cards should be unique. To make sure this is the case, this add-on adds a unique number to fields called `Note ID`.

Add the nid (note id) to a field named "Note ID" when adding or
editing notes, when that field loses focus. When the “Note ID”
field is the first field, this automatically satisfies the rule
that the first field has to be unique.  That means the “real”
fields with interesting content don’t have to be
unique. (Personally, for synonyms i like to have the same content
in the “Expression” or “Meaning” fields, and then put further
information in note or disambiguation fields.)
