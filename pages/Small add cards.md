In the Google forum, there came up the question if there was a way to
make the add card window smaller. This is a quick hack that removes
the size limit.

While it can be argued that the original limit of 400 &times; 400
pixels was too large, there still is a good reason for some minimum
size, as the window becomes useless when you reduce the size too
much. Just make it bigger again in this case.
