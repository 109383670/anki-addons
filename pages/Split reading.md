Use the standard add-ons when learning Japanese or Chinese.

## Japanese

When learning Japanese, using this add-on is much easier when the
[Japanese Support](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3918629684) add-on
has been installed first.

This add-on assumes that there is a field called “Reading” and that
this reading field contains both the Japanese word itself (kanj and
kana written in line) and the reading of the kanji (furigana).  The
furigana should be in square brackets
(“[\[](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/5b/index.htm)”,
“[\]](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/5d/index.htm)”)
after the kanji. A
[space](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/20/index.htm) is
used as the break between leading characters and the kanji for which
there is a reading. For example, for the expression「この間」, the
reading field should contain 「`この 間[あいだ]`」.  Note the space
between 「の」 and 「間」 and the square brackets around the 「あいだ」.

Most of the time these details are not important. This square-bracket
style is exactly what is porduced by the Japanese Support add-on. When
creating cards you typically just type the expression into its field,
and when you go to the meaning field to typet the translation, the
reading field is filled automatically in the right format.


## Chinese

Similarly, when learning Chinese, you should install the
[Chinese support](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3448800906) add-on.

The Chinese source text should follow a similar pattern, with the pinyin in
square brackets after the hanzi. This output is produced automatically
by the Chinese support add-on.

There are a few more points to mention:

* When adding cards, you should delete incorrect readings before
  downloading.
* Manual download: 中[zhōng]学[xué] reading OK for Google TTS

## Use two fields

Test: see [Battieries](Batteries.html)
* pure kanji and pure kana work
