This add-on is just me riding my favorite hobby horse,
[metric time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time#Fractional
days).
I think splitting days into hours, minutes and seconds is about as
silly as splitting lengths into inches, feet, yards, rods, chains and
miles or using pounds and ounces and stones and who-knows-what else for
mass. (Or weight. Better not go
[there](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug (mass))!) (And how much is a
[gallon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallon)‽)

This add-on replaces the standard time-formating function with one
that returns times shorter than a year as days – even times much
shorter than a day. Longer times are written as years with one decimal
place.
