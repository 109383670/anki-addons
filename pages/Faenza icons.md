Replace the sync and statistics icons.

This is an abandoned effort to give Anki 2 a more colorful look. If
you liked the color icons of Anki 1, you may take a look at the
[colorful toolbar](Colorful%20toolbar.html) add-on.

The icons are taken from the
[KFaenza](http://opendesktop.org/content/show.php?content=143890) KDE
icon theme.
