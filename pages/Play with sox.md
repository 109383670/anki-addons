The idea was to make flac and ogg audio files usable on Windows systems.


A standard installation of Anki on Windows system 
can’t handle ogg vorbis or flac audio files. At least at some time,
Anki *did* come with a copy of the sox audio processing program
installed. The idea was simple. As sox can handle ogg and falc files,
why not play those files with sox‽ 

Unfortunately, while sox
can convert and in other ways process, some versions don’t play audio
on Windows systems. Also, it appears that the newest Anki installs
don’t come with sox any more.

Linux and MacOS systems can play sox and flac files without problems anyway.
Unless you have a sox laying around on a Windows system that can play
the audio files you want, there is not much point in this add-on.
