This applies the fix for the
[AnkiDroid problem](http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=1449)
discussed in the Google Code issue tracker. When you see negative
review times, either in AnkiDroid or in the statistics window of the
desktop client, go there for information.

This add-on simply applies the
steps
[described in the thread](http://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/detail?id=1449#c23).
