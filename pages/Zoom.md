A simple add-on to zoom in and out the card content (text).  There are
three ways to zoom:

* With Ctrl++/Ctrl+-
* With Ctrl+mouse wheel
* Through the View/Zoom menu.


The zoom is reset when you switch the main screen (change between deck
browser/deck overview/review) or through the menu.

For each main screen, there can be a standard zoom factor set in the
add-on file. Use the Add-ons menu to edit this. (For example, when you
want the deck list in a bigger font, but have the cards themselves set
up all right already.)
