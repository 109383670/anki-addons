Edit media files with an external editor. At the moment this provides
a way to edit audio files with
[sweep](http://www.metadecks.org/software/sweep/).

Trigger the `Edit/Media/Edit audio` menu item to start sweep with the audio files
of the current card. Then edit them there and save. Replay in Anki to
hear the effect.

[UTSL](http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/u/UTSL.html). The editor to
use can be changed close to the top of the plugin file.
