Use keys easy to use for user of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak
simplified keyboard</a> to answer a question.

The point is to remember the key positions, rather than the characters
the keys usually produce.

There are two sets of keys to use, with the four typing fingers of the
left hand in the row above the home row, going from “again” with the
<span class="qtbase" id="pinky">little finger</span>, through “hard”
with the ring finger, “good” for the middle finger to “easy” for the
index finger.

The second set is in the home position. Left index finger for “again”
and three fingers of the right hand: index finger for “hard”, middle
finger for “good” and ring finger for “easy”.

These keys were selected so that they don't clash with other functions
like add card or edit card.


### Configuration

The keys that are used are defined in a python dictionary. Read the
comments in the source file for details.

I tried to find good keys to use for QWERTY keyboards, but
couldn't. My best idea was to use the four keys for the index fingers,
in the home positions or reaching towards each other. These are there
in a commented-out alternative version of the dictionary.
