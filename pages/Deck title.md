Show the name of the deck you are currently learning in the window

When there is more than one profile, it also shows the current profile name.

### Setup

The behavior of the add-on can be changed in two points by editing
the source file:

* title_separator: What to print between the deck name and program
  name. Normally a spaced n-dash.
* show_subdeck: Whether to show the subdeck you have descendet into
  during learning or only the deck you clicked on in the deck
  browser.
