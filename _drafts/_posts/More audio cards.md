One way to use the downloaded audio is to create a special card for
hearing comprehension.

button at the bottom left. In the <q>Edit Current</q> window click <q>Cards...</q>

### Adding a hearing comprehension card

Click on the <q>+</q> button at the top right. A new tab appears at
the top called <q>Card n</q> (<q>Card 2</q>, â€¦)

Click on that tab. The text in the top left <q>Front Template</q> edit
box will be `Edit to customize<br>` together with the content of the old
card, maybe just a `{{Front}}`, maybe something more complex.

We want the hearing comprehension cards for notes where we have
downloaded the pronunciation. We use the method described as
[Conditional Replacement](http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#conditionalreplacement) in the
[Anki manual](http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html).

Replace the whole content of the top left <q>Front Template</q> box, with
<blockquote><pre><code>{{#Audio}}
Listen.
{{Audio}}
{{/Audio}}</code></pre></blockquote>
and the content of the bottom left <q>Front Template</q> box with
<blockquote><pre><code>Listen.
{{Audio}}
<div>{{Front}}</div>
<div>{{Back}}</div>
</code></pre></blockquote>

Next, to get rid of the generic <q>Card n</q> name, click on the <q>More</q>
button at the bottom and select <q>Rename</q>. In the dialog, pick a
descriptive name.

The `{{#Audio}}`/`{{/Audio}}` pair in the front template means we will
only get this card for notes where we have already downloaded
something.  In this simple case, this pair is not necessary, but when
other fields, like an ID, a hint or the front text are added, this
becomes necessary. Using it here, too, guards against surprises later.

This example assumes the standard field names. When you see `{Unknown
field NN}` in the boxes on the right, you must change the names  to
those of your note, as listed in the  <q>Edit Current</q> window.
